### Queued Parrallism

A compiled programming language based around having individual queues for each thread allowing event and callback driven multithreading behaviour.

Still in heavy development, you can view the project on [Github](https://github.com/qupa-lang/Qupa)

## Road Map
**Pre-Alpha**: Code execution and queue based parallel processing.  
**Alpha**: The interpreter/compiler is able to be written in the language itself.  
**Beta**: The language is now fully written in itself.  
**Release**: Full filesystem and TCP implementation, also including execution stack traces as optional compile behaviour for debugging.
