<h3>Queued Parrallism</h3>
<p>A compiled programming language based around having individual queues for each thread allowing event and callback driven multithreading behaviour.</p>
<p>Still in heavy development, you can view the project on <a href="https://github.com/qupa-lang/Qupa">Github</a></p>
<h2>Road Map</h2>
<p><strong>Pre-Alpha</strong>: Code execution and queue based parallel processing.
<strong>Alpha</strong>: The interpreter/compiler is able to be written in the language itself.
<strong>Beta</strong>: The language is now fully written in itself.
<strong>Release</strong>: Full filesystem and TCP implementation, also including execution stack traces as optional compile behaviour for debugging.</p>
